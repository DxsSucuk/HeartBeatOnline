# HeartMyBeat
This project was created while I was HELLA BORED and thought about how to get my money worth from a 350â‚¬ Ring that I bought.<br>
So I thought about making a leaderboard of my heartbeat. But that's boring. So I let people gamble on what my highest heartbeat of the day will be.

## Selfhost
Just pass your Oura API token as an argument to the backend that should make it run.<br>
For the Frontend just fork change the API in the client.ts file and use Netlify or something I really don't care.
